## Description
This is a short game created for the TI-84 calculator, written in TI-Basic, currently in development. It is designed to work on a standard TI-84 Plus model, adn TI-84 Plus CE.
## Features
- The game has story-based gameplay where the players makes different decisions that shape the narrative and affect the outcome of the game, which leads to multiple paths and different endings.
- These choices are made through various menus on the screen.
- As of right now, one of the paths allows a choose your character screen.
- Certain parts of the game also involve character movement which adds another interactive element beyond just text.
## Current State
- The game is **unfinished** and in its very early stages.
- Currently, there are three paths. One of them is more personal and more of an easter egg. The other two are the actual gameplay paths, but both only have a couple of choices.
## Future Plans
- I hope to add additional levels, along with various storylines.
- I also hope to find ways to test other TI-Basic capabiltiies.
- Once you get to the end of the paths (with what they have right now), the code goes back into each other which is very confusing, and I will fix that keeping them all separate.  
## Installation
1. Download the `.8xp` file from this repository.
2. Transfer the file to your TI-84 calculator using TI Connect CE.
3. Run the program by accessing the "PRGM" menu and selecting the game.
